feat: Add backtesting framework for historical model validation

- Create backtest_runner.ts with comprehensive backtesting logic
- Freeze projections at snapshot timestamp (as-of date)
- Load historical market lines and game results
- Calculate hypothetical bet outcomes with spread/total bets
- Support flat and Kelly bet sizing strategies
- Compute metrics: hit rate, CLV, ROI, drawdown, bankroll growth

Features:
- Snapshot-based: Freeze projections at specific timestamp
- Configurable filters: min edge, min confidence tier
- Bet sizing: Flat (fixed %) or Kelly criterion (1/4 Kelly)
- Metrics: Wins, losses, pushes, hit rate, ROI, avg CLV
- Bankroll tracking: Peak, drawdown, final bankroll
- Supports spread and total bets
