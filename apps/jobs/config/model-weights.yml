# Model Configuration
# Centralized weights, thresholds, and constants for ratings models
# Versioned per model version

v1:
  name: "Ratings v1"
  description: "Feature-based power ratings using z-scores and weighted indices"
  
  # Home Field Advantage (in points)
  hfa: 2.0
  
  # Offensive feature weights (must sum to 1.0)
  offensive_weights:
    ypp_off: 0.30      # Yards per play offense
    pass_ypa_off: 0.20 # Passing yards per attempt offense
    rush_ypc_off: 0.15 # Rushing yards per carry offense
    success_off: 0.20  # Success rate offense
    epa_off: 0.15      # Expected points added offense
  
  # Defensive feature weights (must sum to 1.0 when all present)
  # If defensive yardage stats are missing, weights are renormalized to use only success/EPA
  defensive_weights:
    ypp_def: 0.20      # Yards per play defense (inverted - lower is better)
    pass_ypa_def: 0.20 # Passing yards per attempt defense (inverted)
    rush_ypc_def: 0.15 # Rushing yards per carry defense (inverted)
    success_def: 0.25  # Success rate defense (inverted)
    epa_def: 0.20      # Expected points added defense (inverted)
  
  # Confidence tier thresholds (in points of edge)
  confidence_tiers:
    A: 4.0  # High confidence - strongest opportunities
    B: 3.0  # Medium confidence - good opportunities
    C: 2.0  # Low confidence - use with caution
  
  # Minimum edge threshold for showing picks
